# run.sh Improvements - Change Log

## Overview

The `run.sh` script has been completely rewritten to be more intelligent, robust, and work in multiple environments. It now handles both **fresh installations** and **existing setups** seamlessly.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Backend "Exited too quickly (spawn error)"

**Original Issue:**
```
backend: ERROR (spawn error)
backend                          FATAL     Exited too quickly (process log may have details)
```

**Root Cause:**
- Supervisor configuration hardcoded virtual environment path to `/app/.venv`
- Actual virtual environment was at `/root/.venv` in many environments
- Mismatch caused uvicorn to fail immediately

**Solution:**
- ✅ Script now auto-detects existing virtual environments in multiple locations
- ✅ Uses discovered path in supervisor configuration dynamically
- ✅ Tests virtual environment before using it
- ✅ Creates new venv only if none found

**Code Changes:**
```bash
# Old: Hardcoded path
command=$SCRIPT_DIR/.venv/bin/uvicorn ...

# New: Dynamic path
command=$VENV_PATH/bin/uvicorn ...
```

### 2. Port Conflicts

**Original Issue:**
- Script didn't check if ports 8001, 3000, or 27017 were already in use
- Services would fail silently or get stuck
- No indication of which process was using the port

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added `is_port_in_use()` function with multiple detection methods
- ✅ Checks all required ports before starting services
- ✅ Shows which process is using a port if conflict detected
- ✅ Provides commands to resolve conflicts

### 3. Existing Setup Not Detected

**Original Issue:**
- Script assumed fresh installation every time
- Would try to reinstall everything
- Could break existing configurations
- Wasted time on unnecessary steps

**Solution:**
- ✅ New `detect_existing_setup()` function
- ✅ Checks for existing virtual environments
- ✅ Checks for existing supervisor configurations
- ✅ Detects if system dependencies already installed
- ✅ Skips unnecessary installation steps

### 4. Poor Error Handling

**Original Issue:**
- Script used `set -e` (exit on any error)
- Would abort completely on minor issues
- No graceful degradation
- Limited diagnostics

**Solution:**
- ✅ Changed to `set +e` (continue on errors)
- ✅ Handle each error individually
- ✅ Provide detailed error messages
- ✅ Show last errors from logs
- ✅ Suggest specific fix commands
- ✅ Continue with setup even if non-critical steps fail

### 5. Insufficient Diagnostics

**Original Issue:**
- Basic health checks only
- No detailed error information
- Hard to troubleshoot failures
- No visibility into what went wrong

**Solution:**
- ✅ Comprehensive health checks for backend and frontend
- ✅ Shows last 10 lines from error logs on failure
- ✅ Checks for specific error patterns (port conflicts, missing modules)
- ✅ Created separate diagnostic script (`diagnose.sh`)
- ✅ Provides step-by-step troubleshooting guide

### 6. READONLY Supervisor Configs

**Original Issue:**
- In Kubernetes and container environments, supervisor configs are read-only
- Script would try to overwrite and fail
- Or would overwrite critical production configurations

**Solution:**
- ✅ Detects READONLY marker in supervisor configs
- ✅ Skips supervisor configuration if existing config is protected
- ✅ Uses existing configuration when appropriate

## New Features

### 1. Smart Virtual Environment Detection

**Locations checked (in order):**
1. `/app/.venv`
2. `/root/.venv`
3. `$HOME/.venv`
4. `/tmp/rag-platform-venv` (fallback)

**Validation:**
- Tests if Python binary works
- Checks if pip is available
- Counts installed packages

### 2. Multi-Method Port Detection

**Methods tried (in order):**
1. `ss` command (modern)
2. `netstat` command (traditional)
3. `lsof` command (process-based)
4. Direct TCP connection test (fallback)

### 3. Service Health Checks

**Backend Health:**
```bash
# Tests if backend responds with expected message
curl http://localhost:8001/api/
# Expected: {"message": "RAG Platform API", ...}
```

**Frontend Health:**
```bash
# Tests if frontend serves HTML
curl http://localhost:3000
# Expected: HTML starting with <!DOCTYPE html>
```

**MongoDB Health:**
```bash
# Tests if MongoDB responds to commands
mongosh --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"
# Expected: { ok: 1 }
```

### 4. Graceful Degradation

**System Package Installation:**
- Tries `apt-get` for Debian/Ubuntu
- Falls back to `yum`/`dnf` for CentOS/RHEL
- Continues if some packages fail
- Only fails if critical packages missing

**Python Package Installation:**
- Tries installing from `requirements.txt`
- Falls back to installing packages individually
- Continues with partial installation
- Warns about missing non-critical packages

**Service Starting:**
- Tries `systemctl` (modern)
- Falls back to `service` command
- Falls back to manual start
- Continues even if service manager unavailable

### 5. Comprehensive Logging

**Debug Information:**
- Shows detected OS and version
- Shows found virtual environment paths
- Shows port usage status
- Shows service start attempts

**Error Information:**
- Shows specific error messages
- Shows last lines from log files
- Shows which process is using conflicting port
- Provides fix commands

### 6. Exit Status Handling

**Success Scenarios:**
- Both backend and frontend healthy: Exit 0
- Backend healthy, frontend needs time: Exit 0 (with warning)
- MongoDB running, services configuring: Exit 0

**Failure Scenarios:**
- Critical dependency missing: Continue with warning
- Service won't start: Show diagnostics, exit 1
- Configuration error: Show error, suggest fix

# 2. Create virtual environment
# 3. Install all dependencies
# 4. Configure and start services
# 5. Run health checks
```

### Existing Setup

```bash
# On a system where app is already installed
cd rag-platform
./run.sh

# Script will:
# 1. Detect existing venv at /root/.venv
# 2. Skip system package installation
# 3. Use existing dependencies
# 4. Configure supervisor with correct paths
# 5. Restart services
# 6. Run health checks
```

### After Making Changes

```bash
# After modifying backend code
cd rag-platform
./run.sh

# Script will:
# 1. Detect existing setup
# 2. Skip installation steps
# 3. Update dependencies if needed
# 4. Restart services
# 5. Verify everything works
```

### Troubleshooting

```bash
# Run diagnostics
./diagnose.sh

# Output shows:
# - What's installed
# - What's running
# - What's broken
# - How to fix it

# Fix and retry
./run.sh
```

## Migration Guide

### No Action Required

If your installation is working, you don't need to do anything. The new script will detect your existing setup and work correctly.

### Optional: Clean Reinstall

If you want to start fresh:

```bash
# Stop services
sudo supervisorctl stop all

# Optional: Remove old venv
rm -rf /app/.venv /root/.venv

# Run new script
./run.sh

# Will detect no existing setup and install fresh
```

### Updating Supervisor Config

If you have a custom supervisor config and want to use the new one:

```bash
# Backup your config
sudo cp /etc/supervisor/conf.d/rag-backend.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/rag-backend.conf.backup

# Run script (will detect and ask)
./run.sh

# Script will create new config with correct paths
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Docker Support**: Detect Docker environment and adjust accordingly
2. **Custom Ports**: Allow specifying custom ports via environment variables
3. **SSL/TLS**: Auto-generate and configure SSL certificates
4. **Database Backups**: Automatic MongoDB backup before major operations
5. **Rollback**: Save state and allow rollback on failure
6. **Performance Tuning**: Auto-detect system resources and optimize
7. **Monitoring**: Set up basic monitoring and alerting
8. **Updates**: Check for and apply updates automatically

## Conclusion

The improved `run.sh` script is now:

- ✅ **Production-ready** - Tested in multiple environments
- ✅ **User-friendly** - Just run it and it works
- ✅ **Robust** - Handles errors gracefully
- ✅ **Intelligent** - Adapts to your environment
- ✅ **Well-documented** - Comprehensive guides provided
