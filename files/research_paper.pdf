Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare

Abstract:
This research paper explores AI applications in medical diagnosis.

Key Findings:
1. AI models achieved 94% accuracy in detecting diabetic retinopathy
2. Machine learning reduced diagnosis time from 48 hours to 2 hours
3. Natural language processing improved patient record analysis by 60%

Methodology:
- Dataset: 50,000 medical images from 10 hospitals
- Models tested: CNN, ResNet, Vision Transformers
- Training duration: 6 months

Conclusions:
AI shows promising results in healthcare diagnostics but requires human oversight for critical decisions.
