          "answer": "Our tiered pricing is based on daily data ingestion volume and query concurrency. **Tier 1** (€890/month) supports up to 100 GB/day with 50 concurrent queries, ideal for small to medium teams. **Tier 2** (€3,200/month) handles up to 1 TB/day with 200 concurrent queries, perfect for growing companies. **Tier 3** (€12,500/month) manages up to 10 TB/day with 1,000 concurrent queries, designed for enterprise-scale operations. All tiers include full API access, standard support, and unlimited users. Premium support (24/7) and dedicated engineering resources are available as add-ons.",

We'll calculate a pro-rated amount for the remainder of your billing period. For example, if you upgrade halfway through your annual contract, you'll pay 50% of the difference between Tier 1 and Tier 2 annual pricing. The upgrade is immediate, with no service interruption. Downgrades are only permitted at renewal to ensure service consistency.",

Our streaming connector consumes messages in real-time with at-least-once delivery semantics. Configuration via UI or Terraform: specify bootstrap servers, topics, authentication (SASL, SSL, IAM), and schema (JSON, Avro, Protobuf with schema registry support).

For large migrations (>10 TB), request a free **AWS Snowball** or **Azure Data Box** shipment by contacting data-migration@neuraltech.com. Egress usage visible in billing dashboard.",
